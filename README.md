Q: How are graceful degredation and service workers related?

Graceful degredation which is the reverse approach to progressive enhancement, defines a design philosophy that is aims to perpetuate robustness and reliability with software through solidifying of the backend first and working our way to the interface components. If done correctly, this should prevent the resulting software from failing entirely when faced with feature issues. How graceful degredation and service workers are related is that service workers can be a key part in the process of graceful degredation. Service workers allows us to address a potential issue of how our app will function when offline, so that if the network cuts off we will be able to maintain functionality and usability and thus accessability.
